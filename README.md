this is a temporary folder to hold the unreasonable  reviewers reports as html files

(6 is the Estonian i-voting paper, 13 is the court verifiability e-voting paper)


Html files are hard to view here, download first

Let me acknowledge that I have doubts that there was some kind of hacking/penetration such that those are fake reviews (but this necessiates that the sending emails were also penetrated, not just that I was deceived to upload into a malicious fake site) 


while sending to Track-3 now, I keep generating AI review reports from grok (X formerly Twitter), Gemini (Google), Capilot (Microdoft); then prepare a revised version accordingly
