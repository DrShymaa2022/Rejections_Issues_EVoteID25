To add on this, the paper was rejected again from Track-3 (as submission 46) although enermous improvements were added that do not exist in any SoK of the Estonian i-voting IVXV; especially when you compare with other accepted papers

Also the last paragraph of my future work since 2024 was the idea behind another paper who did not cite me since my paper is not accepted through peer-review yet

this is a temporary folder to hold the unreasonable  reviewers reports as html files

(6 is the Estonian i-voting paper, 13 is the court verifiability e-voting paper)


Html files are hard to view here, download first

Let me acknowledge that I have doubts that there was some kind of hacking/penetration such that those are fake reviews (but this necessiates that the sending emails were also penetrated, not just that I was deceived to upload into a malicious fake site) 


while sending to Track-3 now, I keep generating AI review reports from grok (X formerly Twitter), Gemini (Google), Capilot (Microdoft); then prepare a revised version accordingly 
The last Gemini report is uploaded here

The last Copilot report can be found in (https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/m8NQsuYgD5LqXCvyVmu6N), 
I may add a table as it suggests in the extended version only, but i'm worried why it missed some details at the beginning (like explicit statements in Fig.2 caption about red & green colors)
Ps.

All generated reports recommended acceptance with minor revisions, which I keep doing
