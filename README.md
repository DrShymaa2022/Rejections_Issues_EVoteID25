this is a temporary folder to hold the unreasonable  reviewers reports as html files

(6 is the Estonian i-voting paper, 13 is the court verifiability e-voting paper)


Html files are hard to view here, download first

Let me acknowledge that I have doubts that there was some kind of hacking/penetration such that those are fake reviews (but this necessiates that the sending emails were also penetrated, not just that I was deceived to upload into a malicious fake site) 


while sending to Track-3 now, I keep generating AI review reports from grok (X formerly Twitter), Gemini (Google), Capilot (Microdoft); then prepare a revised version accordingly 
The last Gemini report is uploaded here

The last Copilot report can be found in (https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/m8NQsuYgD5LqXCvyVmu6N), 
I may add a table as it suggests in the extended version only, but i'm worried why it missed some details at the beginning (like explicit statements in Fig.2 caption about red & green colors)
Ps.

All generated reports recommended acceptance with minor revisions, which I keep doing
